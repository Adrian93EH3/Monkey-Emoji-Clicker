# Monkey Emoji Clicker
The point of this project was just to exercise some of my JS skills. Granted, it wasn't anything too difficult, and mainly for the entertainment of my nephews and niece. As the user clicks on the monkeys, their faces change and looks as though the monkey is moving it's hands to show each display.
